## üîß Development

### Building from Source

#### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- PyInstaller for executable building

#### Build Steps
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/Priyanshurajpoot/PTEXTOR.git
cd PTEXTOR

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Build executable
pyinstaller --name PTEXTOR \
    --windowed \
    --onefile \
    --icon=assets/PTEXTOR.ico \
    --add-data "assets;assets" \
    --add-data "src;src" \
    main.py
```

### Architecture

**Key Components:**

- Restart Windows Explorer after registration

**PDF Export Fails**
- Ensure ReportLab is installed: `pip install reportlab>=4.0`
